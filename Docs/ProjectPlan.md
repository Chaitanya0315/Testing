## 1 Introduction

<!--*Here you introduce the product. Keep this  clean and simple, one or two sentences at most.*-->

The purpose of this group project is to create an android application that will give users a platform to play word scramble games, create word scramble games, view various player and scramble statistics as well keep track of their own performance.

## 2 Process Description

<!--*Process description as a set of activities; for each activity, provide the following:*-->

<!--- *Activity name (verb or verb phrase)*
- *Activity description (concise paragraph)*
- *Entrance criteria (inputs needed for the activity)*
- *Exit criteria (outputs produced by the activity and how you know it has been completed satisfactorily)*-->

This section illustrates the various activities, team 47 intends to perform throughout the project. These activities are described in terms of the Rational Unified Process (RUP), highlighting all 4 phases that are inception, elaboration, construction, and transition. As per the requirements, each activity will have an entrance and an exit criteria. Each document and component pertaining to software development process will have various review cycles, resulting in more thorough implementaion.

|**Inception Stage**|**Project Execution Plan:** The purpose of this activity is to clearly identify primary tasks which should be accomplished in order to efficiently  complete the software development targets. Associating the foreseen objectives with main deliverables and arranging them within different stages of RUP will part of this activity. Primary role assignments amongst the team members based on skill set is also part of this activity.<br>**Exit Critieria**: Understaing the problem statement and follow the guidelines of the Rational Unified Process.<br>**Exit Critieria**: Acquire clear knowledge of the project plan which includes detailed process explanation and assignment of team roles.<br>**Use-Case Indentification:** Another major step towards moving the application development process from a concept to a definite design is to clearly understand and interpret the requirements and identifying the actors that shall help the software system to run properly. This activity will be responsible for determining the requirements and the major actors involved in completing those requirements. In our case, we have 2 actors, the Player (human) and the External Web Service (system). The output of this activity is the explanation of the initial use-cases in form of a use case diagram accompanied by description of each scenario.<br>This activity will involve considering the major architectural components, assumptions, and constraints to the system. For example, whether or not the system should be a peer-to-peer or client-server design and what the operating environment will be. Some of these aspects of the design may be specified in the requirements while others may have to be inferred or tentatively selected. Graphical mockups can be constructed|

### Development Team Role Description

**Software Developer**

Tasks of the Software Developer will be to utilize debugging and problem-solving approach in order for developing elemental data structures and working to realize all the use case and design considerations. This team member will contribute to continuously improve software development strategies and would also coordinate any communication pertaining to the external web service (EWS).

**Application UI Developer**
 
This assignment would require the team member to focus primarily on creating the human computer interaction elements of the word scramble application. In order to accomplish the user experience side of this application, UI developer will help the team create GUI activities and will assist the software developer to make sure that these user interaction elements are synchronized with all their corresponding classes/methods.

**Documentation Manager**
 
Team member in this role will be responsible for maintaining the comprehensive architecture and make sure that the application design attains requirements. For documentation purposes, this team member will be responsible for taking information from rest of the team in order to generate/maintain all the documentation/deliverables pertaining to the project. Person in this role will also keep a track of all the design/choices team takes as the project progress through its various stages.
 
**Software Tester** 

Primarily, team member in this role will be responsible for all aspects of application testing such as unit, integration, etc. As the application development process progresses, software tester will keep a record of all the required test cases and will make sure that subsequent versions of the application are producing the desired results. In the case when a particular test does not pass, the software tester will inform and follow-up with the software developer in order to get that issue resolved.
