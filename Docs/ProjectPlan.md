## 1 Introduction

<!--*Here you introduce the product. Keep this  clean and simple, one or two sentences at most.*-->

The purpose of this group project is to create an android application that will give users a platform to play word scramble games, create word scramble games, view various player and scramble statistics as well keep track of their own performance.

## 2 Process Description

<!--*Process description as a set of activities; for each activity, provide the following:*-->

<!--- *Activity name (verb or verb phrase)*
- *Activity description (concise paragraph)*
- *Entrance criteria (inputs needed for the activity)*
- *Exit criteria (outputs produced by the activity and how you know it has been completed satisfactorily)*-->

This section illustrates the various activities, team 47 intends to perform throughout the project. These activities are described in terms of the Rational Unified Process (RUP), highlighting all 4 phases that are inception, elaboration, construction, and transition. As per the requirements, each activity will have an entrance and an exit criteria. Each document and component pertaining to software development process will have various review cycles, resulting in more thorough implementaion.


|**STAGE**| **DESCRIPTION**|
|:---:|:---|
|**Inception Stage**| **ACTIVITY [Project Execution Plan]:** The purpose of this activity is to clearly identify primary tasks which should be accomplished in order to efficiently  complete the software development targets. Associating the foreseen objectives with main deliverables and arranging them within different stages of RUP will part of this activity. Primary role assignments amongst the team members based on skill set is also part of this activity.<br><br>**Entrance Critieria**: Understaing the problem statement and follow the guidelines of the Rational Unified Process.<br><br>**Exit Critieria**: Acquire clear knowledge of the project plan which includes detailed process explanation and assignment of team roles.<br><br>**ACTIVITY [Use-Case Indentification]:** Another major step towards moving the application development process from a concept to a definite design is to clearly understand and interpret the requirements and identifying the actors that shall help the software system to run properly. This activity will be responsible for determining the requirements and the major actors involved in completing those requirements. In our case, we have 2 actors, the Player (human) and the External Web Service (system). The output of this activity is the explanation of the initial use-cases in form of a use case diagram accompanied by description of each scenario.<br><br>**Entrance Critieria**: Having a general idea about system and the associated requirements.<br><br>**Exit Critieria**: Creation of the use cases and the use-case diagram. <br><br>**ACTIVITY [System Components Definition]:** Purpose of this activity is to bring into consideration all of the assumptions, contraints and architectural components pertaining to the design identifying the nature of the software system, which in our case in client (Player) - Server (EWS) based. While some of the requirements of the design can be clearly specified other additional aspects of the design can be illustrated using initial GUI prototypes.<br><br>**Entrance Critieria**: Having better idea about use-case model digram, system as a whole and program requirements.<br><br>**Exit Critieria**: Generation of the detailed design document containing various design requirements such as deployment diagram, class diagram, component diagram, initial GUI protype snapshots, etc.|
|**Elaboration Stage**| **ACTIVITY [System Testing Plan]:** The puprpose of this activity will be to test the initial level use-case model and the feautres discussed in the design document. Along with testing for these initial features and use cases, this acitivity will include other essential sub-activities such as bug tracking and overall quality assurance. Team will make sure to highlight the tools they utilize for this activity and utlimately, team will also test the developed product (initially developed application) against the initial set of test cases. Record keeping for the test case results will be of the essence as the team keeps on progressing with the design.<br><br>**Entrance Critieria**: Features of the design document and the use-case model.<br><br>**Exit Critieria**: Overall testing, bug tracking and proper use-case execution.<br><br>**ACTIVITY [Discovering Non-Functional Requirements]:** As part of this activity, team will identify non-functional/extra requirements that the team believes are important but do not fall into any other documentation category.
