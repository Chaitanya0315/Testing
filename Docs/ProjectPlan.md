## 1 Introduction

<!--*Here you introduce the product. Keep this  clean and simple, one or two sentences at most.*-->

The purpose of this group project is to create an android application that will give users a platform to play word scramble games, create word scramble games, view various player and scramble statistics as well keep track of their own performance.

## 2 Process Description

<!--*Process description as a set of activities; for each activity, provide the following:*-->

<!--- *Activity name (verb or verb phrase)*
- *Activity description (concise paragraph)*
- *Entrance criteria (inputs needed for the activity)*
- *Exit criteria (outputs produced by the activity and how you know it has been completed satisfactorily)*-->

This section illustrates the various activities, team 47 intends to perform throughout the project. These activities are described in terms of the Rational Unified Process (RUP), highlighting all 4 phases that are inception, elaboration, construction, and transition. As per the requirements, each activity will have an entrance and an exit criteria. Each document and component pertaining to software development process will have various review cycles, resulting in more thorough implementaion.

**Stage**: Inception

|||
|:---:|:---|
|**Description**|This activity will involve identifying the main tasks that will need to be achieved in order to successfully execute the program objectives. Developing this plan will involve linking the anticipated tasks to the main deliverables and scheduling them within the different phases outlined in the Rational Unified Process guidelines. This activity will also involve identifying what the primary roles within the team should be and matching team members with these roles according to skill and workload balance. This activity is the first step in taking the project from an idea to an actual design, and involves interpreting the requirements to identify the main users or actors that will interact with the system or allow the system to function. These actors may be human or system actors. This activity also involves interpreting the requirements to identify the primary actions or tasks that will be accomplished by each of the actors, and the interaction between them. The results of this activity will be formalized as initial use cases and a use case diagram, but these outputs may evolve as the project progresses. This activity will involve considering the major architectural components, assumptions, and constraints to the system. For example, whether or not the system should be a peer-to-peer or client-server design and what the operating environment will be. Some of these aspects of the design may be specified in the requirements while others may have to be inferred or tentatively selected. Graphical mockups can be constructed|

### Development Team Role Description

**Software Developer**

Tasks of the Software Developer will be to utilize debugging and problem-solving approach in order for developing elemental data structures and working to realize all the use case and design considerations. This team member will contribute to continuously improve software development strategies and would also coordinate any communication pertaining to the external web service (EWS).

**Application UI Developer**
 
This assignment would require the team member to focus primarily on creating the human computer interaction elements of the word scramble application. In order to accomplish the user experience side of this application, UI developer will help the team create GUI activities and will assist the software developer to make sure that these user interaction elements are synchronized with all their corresponding classes/methods.

**Documentation Manager**
 
Team member in this role will be responsible for maintaining the comprehensive architecture and make sure that the application design attains requirements. For documentation purposes, this team member will be responsible for taking information from rest of the team in order to generate/maintain all the documentation/deliverables pertaining to the project. Person in this role will also keep a track of all the design/choices team takes as the project progress through its various stages.
 
**Software Tester** 

Primarily, team member in this role will be responsible for all aspects of application testing such as unit, integration, etc. As the application development process progresses, software tester will keep a record of all the required test cases and will make sure that subsequent versions of the application are producing the desired results. In the case when a particular test does not pass, the software tester will inform and follow-up with the software developer in order to get that issue resolved.
